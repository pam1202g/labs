                        Statistical Inference is a logical framework used to verify our beliefs 
                        about world events against data. We build probabilistic models to formalize our beliefs.
                        These models are called probabilistic because there are many unknown parts of the system 
                        which we are observing and we are not certain about the occurrence or non-occurrence 
                        of a particular event.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two schools of thoughts when it comes to the process of statistical inference, the Frequentist, and the Bayesian.</p>

                            In Frequentist (or Classical) statistics, we suppose that our sample of data is the result of one of an infinite number of exactly 
                            repeated experiments. The sample we see in this context is assumed to be the outcome of some probabilistic process. 
                            Any conclusions we draw from this approach are based on the supposition that events occur with probabilities, 
                            which represent the long-run frequencies with which those events occur in an infinite series of experimental repetitions. 
                            For example, if we flip a coin, we take the proportion of heads observed in an infinite number of throws 
                            as defining the probability of obtaining heads. Frequentists suppose that this probability actually exists, 
                            and is fixed for each set of coin throws that we carry out. The sample of coin flips we obtain for a fixed and 
                            finite number of throws is generated as if it were part of a longer (that is, infinite) series of repeated coin flips.

                        The Bayesian school of thought does not employ repetition of an event as a tool 
                        to define probability. Probability means something totally different to a Bayesian practitioner. 
                        The probability to them is a measure of uncertainty in a particular belief.
                        We are thus equally able to say, ‘The probability of heads is 0.5’ or 
                        ‘The probability of the Democrats winning the 2020 US presidential election is 0.75’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Probability is a subjective concept so its subject to updation in light of new data.
